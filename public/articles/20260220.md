**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A **RESTful API** exposes resources (e.g. users, orders) as URLs and uses HTTP methods and status codes to define how clients interact with them.

## Introduction

REST treats everything as **resources** identified by **URIs** (e.g. `/users`, `/orders/123`). Clients perform actions using **HTTP methods**:

- **GET**: Read a resource (or list).
- **POST**: Create a new resource.
- **PUT** / **PATCH**: Update a resource.
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource.

Data is usually exchanged as **JSON** (or XML). The server is **stateless**: each request carries enough information for the server to process it; no server-side session is required for the API itself. Caching (e.g. via `Cache-Control`) and a **layered** design (proxies, gateways) are part of the style.

## Usage

RESTful APIs are used for:

- **Web and mobile backends**: CRUD operations, user management, business logic.
- **Public and partner APIs**: Clear, predictable URLs and methods make integration and documentation (e.g. OpenAPI) straightforward.
- **Microservices**: Services call each other over HTTP with a consistent, resource-oriented model.

Design practices include: plural nouns for collections (`/users`), HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500), and versioning via URL or header.

## Pros and cons

**Pros:**

- Simple, well-understood model (HTTP + JSON).
- Stateless and cacheable; scales horizontally.
- Tooling and ecosystem (OpenAPI, clients, gateways) are mature.
- Language- and platform-agnostic.

**Cons:**

- Can lead to many round-trips (e.g. N+1) if not designed with batching or compound resources.
- Over-fetching or under-fetching data unless you use patterns like field selection or GraphQL where needed.
- Real-time or bidirectional use cases are better served by WebSockets or similar.

REST remains the default choice for many APIs; use it when your operations map well to resources and CRUD, and consider alternatives for real-time or highly flexible query needs.
