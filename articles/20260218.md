**SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)** is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an **Identity Provider (IdP)** and a **Service Provider (SP)**. It is commonly used for **Single Sign-On (SSO)** in enterprise and federated environments.

## What is SAML?

SAML allows one system (the **IdP**) to assert to another system (the **SP**) that a user has been authenticated and optionally what attributes they have (e.g. roles, email). The user logs in once at the IdP; the SP trusts the IdP’s assertion and does not need to handle passwords directly.

Key concepts:

- **Assertion**: An XML document that carries identity and attribute information (e.g. name, email, group membership).
- **IdP**: Authenticates the user and issues SAML assertions (e.g. Okta, Azure AD, Keycloak).
- **SP**: The application the user wants to use; it consumes the assertion to grant access.

SAML 2.0 defines bindings (e.g. HTTP Redirect, HTTP POST) for how assertions are sent from IdP to SP, and protocols (e.g. Web SSO) for the login flow.

## Usage

**Typical flow:**

1. User visits the SP (e.g. `https://app.example.com`).
2. SP redirects the user to the IdP with a SAML request (e.g. AuthnRequest).
3. User logs in at the IdP (if not already logged in).
4. IdP sends the user back to the SP with a SAML response containing an **assertion** (e.g. via form POST).
5. SP validates the response (signature, audience, expiry) and establishes a session for the user.

**Where SAML is used:**

- **Enterprise SSO**: Employees use one login for many internal and SaaS apps (e.g. Google Workspace, Salesforce) via an enterprise IdP.
- **B2B federation**: A partner’s IdP asserts identity to your application so their users don’t need separate accounts.
- **Compliance**: Industries that require centralized identity and audit trails often use SAML with an IdP that enforces MFA and logging.

SAML is well-suited to browser-based SSO and enterprise identity; for modern APIs and mobile apps, **OAuth 2.0** and **OpenID Connect** are often used alongside or instead of SAML.
