**WebSocket** is a protocol that provides **full-duplex** communication over a single TCP connection. Unlike HTTP’s request–response pattern, WebSocket allows the server to push data to the client at any time, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## Introduction

A WebSocket connection starts with an **HTTP upgrade** request from the client. The server responds with `101 Switching Protocols`, and thereafter the connection stays open for **bidirectional** frames (text or binary). Both client and server can send messages without a prior request.

WebSocket is **stateful**: the connection is long-lived and identified by the underlying TCP connection. It is well-suited to chat, live dashboards, notifications, and collaborative editing, where low latency and push from server are important.

## Pros and cons

**Pros:**

- **Low latency**: No repeated HTTP handshakes; data can be sent as soon as it is available.
- **Efficient**: Overhead per message is small (frame header only).
- **Bidirectional**: Server can push without client polling.
- **Same ports**: Uses HTTP/HTTPS ports (80/443), so it works through most firewalls and proxies.

**Cons:**

- **Stateful**: Servers must manage connection lifecycle and scale connection count; load balancing is trickier than for stateless HTTP.
- **No built-in semantics**: You define your own message format and meaning (unlike REST’s resource/method model).
- **Reconnection**: Clients must implement reconnection and backoff; the protocol does not define session recovery.

## Comparison with REST

| Aspect | WebSocket | REST (HTTP) |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Model** | Persistent connection, bidirectional | Request–response, client-initiated |
| **Server push** | Native | Requires polling or SSE |
| **State** | Stateful (connection) | Stateless (per request) |
| **Typical use** | Real-time, chat, live updates | CRUD, query, one-off operations |

Use WebSocket when you need real-time or push; use REST for standard CRUD and query APIs. Many systems use both: REST for operations and WebSocket (or Server-Sent Events) for real-time streams.
