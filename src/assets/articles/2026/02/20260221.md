**SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)** is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services. It uses **XML** for messages and typically runs over HTTP (or SMTP, TCP). SOAP is **strongly specified**: it defines envelopes, encoding rules, and bindings, and is often used with **WSDL** for service description.

## Introduction

A SOAP message is an **XML document** with a defined structure:

- **Envelope**: Root element; contains optional **Header** and a **Body**.
- **Header**: Optional; for security, routing, or other metadata.
- **Body**: Contains the actual operation and payload.

SOAP is **protocol-independent** in design but is commonly used over HTTP. Operations are often described in a **WSDL (Web Services Description Language)** file, which clients use to generate stubs and understand request/response shapes. **WS-*** standards (e.g. WS-Security, WS-Addressing) extend SOAP for security and reliability.

## Pros and cons

**Pros:**

- Strong typing and contract (WSDL); good tooling for code generation.
- Built-in support for security (WS-Security) and reliability (WS-ReliableMessaging) in enterprise settings.
- Language- and platform-neutral; widely used in legacy and integration scenarios.

**Cons:**

- Verbose XML; heavier payloads and parsing than JSON.
- More complex to implement and debug than REST.
- Less common for new greenfield APIs; REST and JSON dominate modern APIs.

## Comparison with REST

| Aspect | SOAP | REST |
|--------|------|------|
| **Format** | XML | Usually JSON (or XML) |
| **Style** | Protocol / operation-oriented | Resource-oriented, HTTP methods |
| **Contract** | WSDL | Often OpenAPI / informal |
| **Overhead** | Higher (XML, envelope) | Lower (compact JSON) |
| **Typical use** | Enterprise integration, legacy systems | Web/mobile APIs, microservices |

Use SOAP when you need strict contracts, WS-* features, or integration with existing SOAP services; prefer REST (or GraphQL) for most new APIs and simpler client integration.
