**Token-based authentication** and **JWT (JSON Web Token)** are two widely used approaches for securing APIs and web applications. Both involve sending a credential (a "token") from client to server so the server can verify identity without storing session state. This article introduces both methods and compares their usage.

## Token-based authentication

In a typical **token** flow (often called *opaque token* or *session token*):

1. The user logs in with credentials (e.g. username/password).
2. The server validates the credentials and creates a **session** (stored on the server or in a database).
3. The server returns a **token** (a random string, often stored in a cookie or sent in a header).
4. On later requests, the client sends this token; the server looks up the session and identifies the user.

The token itself is usually an opaque identifier. The server must **look up** the token in storage to know who the user is and what permissions they have. Revocation is straightforward: delete the session or mark the token invalid in storage.

## JWT (JSON Web Token)

A **JWT** is a **self-contained** token: it encodes claims (e.g. user id, roles, expiry) in a signed (and optionally encrypted) string. It has three parts, separated by dots: **Header.Payload.Signature**.

- **Header**: Algorithm and type (e.g. `{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}`).
- **Payload**: Claims (e.g. `sub`, `exp`, `roles`) in JSON.
- **Signature**: Cryptographic signature so the server can verify the token was issued by a trusted party and not tampered with.

The server that **issues** the JWT signs it with a secret or key. The server that **validates** it only needs to verify the signature and check expiry; it does **not** need to look up the token in a database (unless you add a revocation list or short-lived tokens with a refresh flow).

## Comparison and usage

| Aspect | Opaque token | JWT |
|--------|--------------|-----|
| **Storage** | Server (or DB) stores session/token mapping | No server-side storage for the token itself |
| **Validation** | Lookup required | Verify signature + claims only |
| **Revocation** | Easy: invalidate in storage | Harder: need blocklists or short expiry + refresh |
| **Scale / stateless** | More load on session store | Stateless; good for distributed systems |
| **Size** | Often small (id only) | Larger (all claims in payload) |

**When to use opaque tokens:** When you need simple, immediate revocation (e.g. "log out everywhere") and have a central session store.

**When to use JWT:** When you want stateless auth, microservices that only need to verify the token without calling a central DB, or short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens for revocation.

Both are valid; the choice depends on your requirements for statelessness, revocation, and operational complexity.
